# Astk

**Astk** allows to calculate sky luminance and sky sources to be used with FSPM light models from weather data.

## Contents

- sky_irradiance: Equation for determining global horizontal irradiance (GHI), direct normal irradiance (DNI) and diffuse horizontal irradiance under clearsky
condition or estimate them from meteorological data using pvlib library.
- sun_position: Sun position using pvlib library.
- sun_position_astk : Astronomical equation for determining sun position.
- TimeControl: Provides utilities for scheduling models in simulation.
- Weather: Provides utilities for weather protocol and conversion of some weather variable.
- data_access: Set of function to work with resources that are located inside this package data.
- icosphere : Generation of regular spherical polyhedrons: icospheres and their hexagonal/pentagonal duals.
- plantgl_utils: A generic module to get plant variable from scene.
- sky_sources: A collection of equation for modelling sun position, sun irradiance and sky irradiance.

## Installation

### Users

```
mamba create -n astk -c openalea3 -c conda-forge openalea.astk openalea.plantgl matplotlib
```

### Developpers

```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/openalea-incubator/astk.git'
cd astk
# this will create a fresh astk_dev env for you
mamba env create -f ./conda/environment.yml
# As an alternative, if you want to work in an existing environment:
mamba install --only-deps -c openalea3 - c conda-forge openalea.astk
pip install -e .[doc,test,usr]
```

## Quick start

```python
from openalea.astk.sky_irradiance import sky_irradiance
from openalea.astk.sky_sources import sky_sources

irradiance = sky_irradiance()
sources = sky_sources('all-weather', irradiance)
```

See other example in the documentation
